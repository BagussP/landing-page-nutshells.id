        <p>
          By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply
          to you - you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully
          before using the app. You&apos;re not allowed to copy or modify the
          app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You&apos;re
          not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you
          also shouldn&apos;t try to translate the app into other languages or
          make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks,
          copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights
          related to it, still belong to Nutshell&apos;s.id.

          Nutshell&apos;s.id is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful
          and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to
          make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and
          for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services

          The Info Sabilussalam app stores and processes personal data that you
          have provided to us, to provide my Service. It&apos;s your
          responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
          therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,
          which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations
          imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make
          your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
          compromise your phone&apos;s security features and it could mean that
          the Info Sabilussalam app won&apos;t work properly or at all.

          You should be aware that there are certain things that
          Nutshell&apos;s.id will not take responsibility for. Certain functions
          of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection.
          The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
          provider, but Nutshell&apos;s.id cannot take responsibility for the
          app not working at full functionality if you don&apos;t have access to
          Wi-Fi, and you don&apos;t have any of your data allowance left.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          If you&apos;re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
          remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
          provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
          mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
          connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In
          using the app, you&apos;re accepting responsibility for any such
          charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of
          your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
          roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
          you&apos;re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you
          have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the same lines, Nutshell&apos;s.id cannot always take
          responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure
          that your device stays charged - if it runs out of battery and you
          can&apos;t turn it on to avail the Service, Nutshell&apos;s.id cannot
          accept responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to Nutshell&apos;s.id&apos;s responsibility for your use
          of the app, when you&apos;re using the app, it&apos;s important to
          bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated
          and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
          information to us so that we can make it available to you.
          Nutshell&apos;s.id accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
          indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
          functionality of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
          available on Android - the requirements for the system(and for any
          additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to)
          may change, and you&apos;ll need to download the updates if you want
          to keep using the app. Nutshell&apos;s.id does not promise that it
          will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works
          with the Android version that you have installed on your device.
          However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when
          offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
          terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
          to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
          rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you
          must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
